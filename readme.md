## Configurable configs

********************************
I coined a bit strange term that expresses fundamentals: In one config file, define separate sections - stages, which can be digested on demand by the app.

## Instalation

********************************

1. Save downloaded scripts into any folder
2. Cd to script folder

## Run demos

********************************

`py usage.py`  
`py usage_simplified.py`
